# ‚è∞Overview

Timeboxing is a time management technique widely used in agile methodologies, which can be customized for various purposes, including personal use. This tool provides for the predefinition of fixed time periods in which chosen activities are carried out, according to the demands and needs of each one. In other words, a certain value of minutes or hours is chosen for the execution of some task.

## ü§î How to use it?
1. Brain dumping: list all activities and everything that goes through the mind;
2. Top Priorities: list only 3 main activities that we need to carry out;
3. Distribute activities according to the hours of the day.

# ü§© Getting started
To get started, you first need to install:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- and a package manager such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (this comes as default with node) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Now you need to install any code editor you want. 
In this case, I recommend you to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is free.
If you decide to use VSCode, you can install the following extensions which will make your life easier:
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

  _If you want it to auto-fix the lint problems whenever you save your changes, you can refer to their [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint) and activate it on your environment._
 ## üëá Cloning and installing dependencies
First, you need to clone this repository. To do this, paste the code below on your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipemelo2002/time-boxing.git time-boxing
```
Then you can checkout to the folder you just created:
```bash
cd time-boxing
```
Lastly, you can install the dependencies. You can either user `NPM` or `Yarn`:
```bash
yarn install
```
or
```bash
npm install
```
